****Title: Quantum-Blockchain Integrated Supply Chain for Secure and Transparent Vaccine Transportation***


*****Theme Alignment: AI & Data Science for Social Impact, Healthcare Engineering

This project aligns strongly with the themes of AI & Data Science for Social Impact and Healthcare Engineering. By integrating blockchain, quantum-safe communication, IoT, and AI-driven analytics, the system addresses critical challenges in the healthcare sector‚Äîparticularly vaccine transportation‚Äîensuring transparency, trust, and integrity in cold chain logistics.


For Social Impact: The solution ensures equitable vaccine distribution, prevents counterfeiting, and improves public trust in immunization programs, especially in resource-constrained regions.

For Healthcare Engineering: It leverages advanced technologies to maintain temperature integrity, monitor supply chains in real-time, and meet stringent regulatory compliance for safe medical logistics.

***Aim***
Leverage Blockchain technology for traceability, transparency, and auditability, combined with Quantum Communication (specifically Quantum Key Distribution - QKD) for ultra-secure data transmission in the end-to-end vaccine supply chain, ensuring safety, authenticity, and real-time integrity monitoring during transportation.


****Description****
Cold supply chain management refers to the transportation and storage of temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, pharmaceuticals, fresh food, and biotechnology material under controlled conditions to maintain product quality and efficacy. The proposed hybrid system integrates Blockchain and Quantum Communication to enhance security, efficiency, and trust in vaccine transportation.



***Methodology****
‚Ä¢	Qiskit: A quantum computing framework to simulate quantum circuits and  algorithms.
‚Ä¢	Blockchain: A Python-based blockchain framework that supports quantum key exchange and enhanced security mechanisms.
‚Ä¢	Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): A protocol to securely exchange keys between nodes in the blockchain network, ensuring that keys cannot be intercepted or tampered with, as it is based on the quantum mechanics ‚ÄúNo-Cloning‚Äù theorem. 
‚Ä¢	Quantum Hashing: The use of quantum hash functions to ensure the integrity of blocks and protect against quantum computational attacks. It leverages quantum circuits to compute hashes that are immune to quantum attacks, protecting the blockchain from tampering or collision attacks. 
‚Ä¢	Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Anomaly Detection: A quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm that detects anomalies or suspicious behavior in the blockchain network, improving its trust in vaccine transportation.

****Use Case in Vaccine Transportation***
ÔÉò	Ensures cold chain integrity through IoT sensors whose data is uploaded securely on a blockchain.
ÔÉò	Prevents counterfeit vaccines by maintaining end-to-end traceability.
ÔÉò	Enables real-time monitoring and alerts for anomalies such as temperature excursions, route deviations, or delays.
ÔÉò	Quantum-safe security guarantees long-term confidentiality of medical records and transit data.
This project provides hands-on experience on the 
ÔÅ∂	Scalability of QKD protocols across multiple blockchain nodes.
ÔÅ∂	Classical blockchains, which rely on RSA or ECC, are vulnerable to quantum algorithms. Quantum blockchain addresses this vulnerability by utilizing cryptographic protocols based on quantum‚Äêsafe algorithms such as lattice‚Äêbased, hash‚Äêbased, or multivariate polynomial cryptography. This makes them immune to quantum‚Äêbased attacks.
ÔÅ∂	Implementing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) combined with quantum cryptography for data privacy.
ÔÅ∂	Exploring Quantum Proof-of-Work mechanisms for quantum block mining.
